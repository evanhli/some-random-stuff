Tips:

Filling an array from the front is slow, if possible write values to the back
Instead of deleting entries, consider overwriting, as deleteing is O(n) to move the rest of the elements forward
When dealing with an array of integers, consider processing the array back to front or reverse it so you're dealing with the least significant digit first
Get comfortable with your array library and working with subarrays
Don't worry about data integrity till you have to return
