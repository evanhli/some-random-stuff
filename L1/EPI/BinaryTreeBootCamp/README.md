Root node is depth 0
Height of Binary tree is its maximum depth

Depth of a node is the number of nodes with its search path excluding the node `n` itself

Top tips:

Use recursion, recursion has an implicit function call stak when doing space complexity analysis
Consider left and right skewed trees during complexity analysis
It's easy to make the mistake of treating a node that has a single child as a leaf
