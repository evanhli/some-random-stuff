# some-random-stuff

A repo to track all the programming stuff that I don't know and have been meaning to learn.
I've separated sets of skills/things I want to learn in to levels for progress tracking/motiviation.

L1.
- ~~Function method implementations~~
- ~~Promise implementation (I didn't really get the full A+ compliant version so I just implemented a small 'usable' bit)~~
- Redux vs Mobx and how they implement flux differently
- What the heck is really going on with client-side routing
- Throw in 2 EPI chapters for kicks

L2.
- D3 basics and shortcomings
- TDD best practices and SOLID
- Object oriented programming best practices (read a book or amalgamate some principles)
- Electron Apps basics and short comings
- What the heck is really going on with express and server-side routing
- 3 EPI Chapters

L3.
- Angular 7 and Vue async TODO apps
